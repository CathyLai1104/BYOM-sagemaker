    "MNIST is a widely used dataset for handwritten digit classification. It consists of 70,000 labeled 28x28 pixel grayscale images of hand-written digits. The dataset is split into 60,000 training images and 10,000 test images. There are 10 classes (one for each of the 10 digits). In this part of the lab, you will train and test an MNIST model on Amazon SageMaker using MXNet and the Gluon API."
